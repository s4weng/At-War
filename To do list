High Priority -
In progress:
- Fix segfaults from not removing projectiles (and enemy?) properly
- Set different damages for different attacks
- Modify animations to generalize standLeft/walkLeft + similar situations



Medium Priority -
- rename textureInfo to resourceInfo...in all files involving "TextureInfo.hpp"
- relocate attack commands from hero class to entity class


Low Priority/Functionality -
- Implement ally AI
- *Maybe* switch data class for XML
- End game upon playerHero death (segfault if player dies and game continues for awhile)


NTS - Stopped forwarding commands when one receiver receives it; may cause bugs later on.
