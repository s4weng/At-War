High Priority -
- return key gets passed as key binding (instead of just activating button)
- standLeft/walkRight keys and animations overlap; animation still associated with standLeft key but key associated with walkLeft -> - Modify animation classes so frame 0 is not looped during animation; but is default (i.e. standLeft and walkLeft will be from same texturesheet)


Medium Priority -



Low Priority/Functionality -
- Switch global returnTextureSheet method in Hero.cc with nested map or 2d array
- AI input in order to spawn allies (animation related issue)
- Settings tab in main menu and paused screen
