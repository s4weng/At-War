High Priority -
In progress:
- Animations 
	-> Projectiles falling (arrows) and breaking
	-> Archer attack animation flashes first frame at the end
	-> Both archer and druid death animation flashes first frame at end
- Melee attacks
- New battlefield not yet implemented (spawn enemies upon new battlefield is thus not tested)
- More data variety


Medium Priority -
- Set different damages for different attacks (in handleCollisions function in World)
- End game upon playerHero death (segfault if player dies and game continues for awhile)
- Change collision such that Z-layer is in effect (i.e. if player is three levels above its attack shouldn't hit)



Low Priority/Functionality -
- Implement ally AI
- *Maybe* switch data class for XML
- rename textureInfo to resourceInfo...in all files involving "TextureInfo.hpp"
- Classify Fonts (TextureInfo)


NTS - Stopped forwarding commands when one receiver receives it; may cause bugs later on.
