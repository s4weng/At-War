High Priority -
- (In progress #1) standLeft/walkRight keys and animations overlap; animation still associated with standLeft key but key associated with walkLeft -> - Modify animation classes so frame 0 is not looped during animation; but is default (i.e. standLeft and walkLeft will be from same texturesheet) -> Implement with gameplay


Medium Priority -
- rename textureInfo to resourceInfo...in all files involving "TextureInfo.hpp"



Low Priority/Functionality -
- Switch global returnTextureSheet method in Hero.cc with nested map or 2d array
- AI input in order to spawn allies (animation related issue)
- Proper classification of player/ally/enemy
- *Maybe* switch data class for XML



In progress:

1.
- Fix lack of arrow texture upon attack
- Why is spacebar not read as realtime input?
- Modify animations to generalize standLeft/walkLeft
- Add texturesheet for druid (testing AI enemy)
