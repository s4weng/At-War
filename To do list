High Priority -
In progress:
- When you hold two movements keys, action overrides
- Animations 
	-> Archer attack animation flashes first frame at the end
	-> Both archer and druid death animation flashes first frame at end
- New battlefield not yet implemented (spawn enemies upon new battlefield is thus not tested)
- More data variety


Medium Priority -
- Obstacles on maps (pillars, boulders)
- Set different damages for different attacks (in handleCollisions function in World)
- End game upon playerHero death (segfault if player dies and game continues for awhile)



Low Priority/Functionality -
- Implement ally AI
- *Maybe* switch data class for XML
- rename textureInfo to resourceInfo...in all files involving "TextureInfo.hpp"
- Classify Fonts (TextureInfo)


NTS - Stopped forwarding commands when one receiver receives it; may cause bugs later on.
