High Priority -
In progress:
- Animations 
	-> AnimatedSprite means modifying Hero class/textures in general to support returning the bounding rectangle
	-> Archer attack animation flashes first frame at the end
- Melee attacks
- More data variety


Medium Priority -
- Set different damages for different attacks
- End game upon playerHero death (segfault if player dies and game continues for awhile)



Low Priority/Functionality -
- Implement ally AI
- *Maybe* switch data class for XML
- rename textureInfo to resourceInfo...in all files involving "TextureInfo.hpp"
- Classify Fonts (TextureInfo)


NTS - Stopped forwarding commands when one receiver receives it; may cause bugs later on.
